# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Thirdweb as the IPFS Storage and Web3 Wallet

Here Thirdweb is used as IPFS website storage and also as a Web3 wallet, you are free to use anything else for IPFS storage or Web3 wallet and need to change the wrapping provider structure.

### `Fiture`

- Web3 wallet for user can connect and get to their saved videos
- Saved videos, user can save videos to their list
- PWA supported, and overlay PWA on footer make it easy to spot and install by button
- Light and dark mode
- Download button (for live video it trigger for got to room at their platform, other that it trigger for download videos)
- Shortener url, that will trigger with download button, this will shorten the url and go to shortnener url site before go to main url

### `Replace with yours`

- Thirdweb clientId on src/App.js
- Database enpoint for saved videos on src/components/SavedVideos.js
- Database endpoint for comment form on src/components/CommentForm.js
- Url shortener endpoint on src/components/DownloadVideo.js
- All videos API endpoint on src/components/pages/Homepage.js
- And each platform page components on src/components/page/

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
